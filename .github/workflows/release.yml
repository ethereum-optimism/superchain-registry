      # If releases break due to dirty `Cargo.lock` changes, toggle this step back on.
      # If the cargo lock file changes due to upstream dependency versions updating,
      # with semvers still matching, the workflow will have "uncommitted" changes
      # which would prevent the release. This step commits any `Cargo.lock` changes
      # so the release can proceed.
