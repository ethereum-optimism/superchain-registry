# Immutable references indicate the positions of the immutables in the bytecode. The combined contract JSON generated by
# the compiler at the stated tag below will contain such references (See example below). To add new contracts with immutables/
# update a contracts's immutables, paste the snippet of `"immutableReferences"` from the contract json file. Immutable values
# are likely different in every deployment of the contract. So we mask the value of the immutable references in the bytecode
# before computing any hash for checking
#
# Example: ethereum-optimism/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/forge-artifacts/MIPS.sol/MIPS.json
#
# "immutableReferences":{"85798":[{"start":178,"length":32},{"start":1771,"length":32}]}}
