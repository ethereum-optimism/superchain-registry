# extra

This is a collection of extra configuration data because not all address and system-config information is available through L1 for some chains.

- [addresses.json](./addresses/addresses.json): L1 Smart Contract addresses for each network.
- [bytecodes](./bytecodes/): The bytecode that is pulled into the compressed genesis system configuration file.
- [genesis](./genesis/): Compressed genesis system configuration data.
