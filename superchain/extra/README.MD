# extra

This is a collection of extra configuration data because not all address and system-config information is available through L1 for some chains.

- [addresses.json](./addresses/addresses.json): L1 Smart Contract addresses for each network.
- [bytecodes](./bytecodes/): The full bytecode that is factored out of compressed genesis system configuration file. Not designed for human consumption.
- [genesis](./genesis/): Compressed genesis system configuration data. Not designed for human consumption.
