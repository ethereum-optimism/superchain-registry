# configs

The main configuration source, with genesis data, and address of onchain system configuration.

This is a collection of extra configuration data because not all address and system-config information is available through L1 for some chains.

Each chain configuration file in this directory contains configuration data that was generated from the [add-chain](../../add-chain/) code.
