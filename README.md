# superchain-registry

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is a **work in progress**.  At a later date, it will be proposed to, and must be approved by, Optimism Governance.  Until that time, the configuration described here is subject to change.

The Superchain Registry is an index of chains which serves as the source of truth for who‚Äôs in the Superchain and what modifications they‚Äôve made to their chains.

## Quickstart 

* ### [üëÄ See who's in the Superchain](chainList.json) 
* ### [‚öôÔ∏è Look at more detailed config information for each chain](superchain/configs)
* ### [üìù Add a new chain to the Superchain Registry](documentation/add-chain.md)

## More about the Superchain Registry

The Superchain Registry hosts Superchain-configuration data in a minimal human-readable form and includes mainnet and testnet Superchain targets, along with their respective member chains.

Other configuration, such as contract-permissions and `SystemConfig` parameters are hosted and governed onchain.

A list of chains in the registry can be seen in the top level [`chainList.toml`](./chainList.toml) and [`chainList.json`](./chainList.json) files.
These files are autogenerated from scripts in the registry and will remain stable to build against.

### Downstream packages

The superchain configs are stored in a minimal form, and are embedded in downstream OP-Stack software ([`op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) and [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)). This means that, after a chain has been added to the registry, and the dependency on the registry updates in the downstream software, it is possible to start an `op-node` instance [using the `--network` flag](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/configuration/consensus-config#network) (and also an `op-geth` instance [using the `--op-network` tag](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/configuration/execution-config#op-network-betaop-network)) which will successfully sync with other nodes on that network.
