# superchain-registry

> ⚠️ This repository is a **work in progress**.  At a later date, it will be proposed to, and must be approved by, Optimism Governance.  Until that time, the configuration described here is subject to change.

The Superchain Registry repository hosts Superchain-configuration data in a minimal human-readable form.
This includes mainnet and testnet Superchain targets, and their respective member chains.

Other configuration, such as contract-permissions and `SystemConfig` parameters are hosted and governed onchain.

The superchain configs are made available in minimal form, to embed in OP-Stack software.
Full deployment artifacts and genesis-states can be derived from the minimal form
using the reference [`op-chain-ops`] tooling.

The `semver.yaml` file represents the semantic versioning lockfile for the all of the smart contracts in the superchain.
It is meant to be used when building transactions that upgrade the implementations set in the proxies.

## Go Module

Superchain configs can be imported as Go-module:
```
go get github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/superchain@latest
```
See [`op-chain-ops`] for config tooling and
 for smart-contract bindings.
