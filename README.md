The Superchain Registry is an index of chains which serves as the source of truth for who‚Äôs in the Superchain and what modifications they‚Äôve made to their chains.

## Quickstart

* ### [üëÄ See who's in the Superchain](chainList.json)
* ### [‚öôÔ∏è View detailed config information for each chain](superchain/configs)
* ### [üìù Add a new chain to the Superchain Registry](docs/add-chain.md)

## More about the Superchain Registry

The Superchain Registry hosts Superchain-configuration data in a minimal human-readable form and includes mainnet and testnet Superchain targets, along with their respective member chains.

Other configurations, such as contract-permissions and `SystemConfig` parameters, are hosted and governed onchain.

A list of chains in the registry can be seen in the top level [`chainList.toml`](./chainList.toml) and [`chainList.json`](./chainList.json) files.
These files are autogenerated from scripts in the registry and will remain stable to build against.

A glossary, with key terms and more information about Superchain levels and requirements, is available [here](docs/glossary.md).

### Downstream packages

The Superchain configs are stored in a minimal form and embedded in downstream OP-Stack software ([`op-node`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) and [`op-geth`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth)). This means that after a chain has been added to the registry and the dependency on the registry updates in the downstream software, it is possible to start an `op-node` instance [using the `--network` flag](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/configuration/consensus-config#network) (and also an `op-geth` instance [using the `--op-network` tag](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/configuration/execution-config#op-network-betaop-network)) which will successfully sync with other nodes on that network.
