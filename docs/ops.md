# Superchain Registry Operations

## Adding a Chain

The following are the steps you need to take to add a chain to the registry:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your chain is listed at [ethereum-lists/chains](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains).
> This is to ensure your chain has a unique chain ID. Our validation suite will
> check against this repository. This is a mandatory prerequisite before being
> added to the registry.

### 0. Standard Chains: Deploy your chain with `op-deployer`

If you are deploying a standard chain, it _must_ be deployed with `op-deployer` to be considered standard in the Superchain Registry. Check out
the [docs](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer) for more information on how to use it.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that most chains use `op-deployer`. `op-deployer` can be configured to support L3s, alt-DA and custom gas token chains.
> If you do not use `op-deployer`, you will need to manually create your config file.
> See [Adding a custom chain](#adding-a-custom-chain) below for more.

### 1. Install dependencies

Install the following dependencies:

| Dependency                                                            | Version   | Version Check Command |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| [git](https://git-scm.com/)                                           | `^2`      | `git --version`       |
| [go](https://go.dev/)                                                 | `^1.21`   | `go version`          |
| [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) | `^1.28.0` | `just --version`      |

### 2. Fork this repository

You will be raising a Pull Request from your fork to the upstream repo.

We recommend only adding one chain at a time, and starting with a fresh branch of this repo for every chain.

### 3. Generate a config from your state file

From the root of this directory, run the following:

```
just create-config <shortname> <path to your state file>
```

Where  `shortname` is your chain's name (e.g. `op`) and the path to the state file points to the `state.json` file generated by `op-deployer`.

This will put two files in the `.staging` directory - `<shortname>.toml` and `<shortname>.json.zst`

### 4. Update generated config

Update `<shortname>.toml` with your chain's information. Most of the data is automatically populated from your deployer
state file, however you will need to populate the following yourself:

- `name`: Human-readable name for your chain.
- `superchain`: Which superchain your chain belongs to. Can be `sepolia` or `mainnet`.
- `public_rpc`: Public RPC endpoint for your chain.
- `sequencer_rpc`: Sequencer RPC endpoint for your chain.
- `explorer`: Block explorer for your chain.
- `deployment_tx_hash`: Transaction hash of the transaction OP Deployer generated to deploy your chain. You'll need
  to look this up on Etherscan for now. It will be automatically populated in the future.

Don't forget to double-check the config for any inaccuracies.

### 5. Commit

Commit your changes to your fork, then open a pull request. When opening your PR:

- Open it from a non-protected branch in your fork (e.g. avoid the `main` branch). This allows maintainers to push to
  your branch if needed, which streamlines the review and merge process.
- Open one PR per chain you would like to add. This ensures the merge of one chain is not blocked by unexpected issues.
- Once the PR is opened, please check the box
  to [allow edits from maintainers](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

Automated checks will run on your PR to validate your chain. A report will also be generated that describes your chain's
level of compliance with the standard blockchain charter.

### 6. Await Review

A member of our team will review your PR. When ready, we will generate code from your PR and push to your fork.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't run codegen yourself. This will slow down review.


## Adding a custom chain

We **strongly recommend** that you use `op-deployer` to deploy your chain.
`op-deployer` can be configured to create L3s, alt-DA and custom gas token chains.
(See the [`op-deployer` docs](https://devdocs.optimism.io/op-deployer/) for more.)
However, if your chain requires further modifications, you may need to use a custom deployment method and
manually create the files needed to add your chain to the Superchain Registry.

After [installing the dependencies](#1-install-dependencies) and [forking this repository](#2-fork-this-repository),
as specified above, you will need to manually generate the config file.

### 1. Creating the config file

Your config file is a toml file that looks something like this. You can copy this config file and put it in
the `.staging` directory in your fork.
**You must substitute the values in this file with the correct values for your chain.**

```

### 2. Manually update the config.

**You must ensure that every field in this file has been updated for your chain.**

### Chain metadata

The first part of the config contains important metadata about your chain. These fields include:

- `name`: Human-readable name for your chain.
- `superchain`: Which superchain your chain belongs to. Can be `sepolia` or `mainnet`.
- `public_rpc`: Public RPC endpoint for your chain.
- `sequencer_rpc`: Sequencer RPC endpoint for your chain.
- `explorer`: Block explorer for your chain.
- `superchain_level`: For custom chains, this must be `0`.
- `governed_by_optimism`: For custom chains, this must be `false`.
- `data_availability_type`: Which data availability layer your chain uses. Can be `eth-da` or `alt-da`.
- `chain_id`: Your chain ID. Must match the ID specified in [ethereum-lists/chains](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains).
- `deployment_tx_hash`: Transaction hash of the transaction generated to deploy your chain.
- `deployment_l1_contracts_version`: Must match the OP Contracts version tag that was used to deploy your L1 contracts.
- `deployment_l2_contracts_version`: Must match the OP Contracts version tag that was used to deploy your L2 contracts.

#### Hardforks

The `[hardforks]` section includes overrides for hardfork activation times.
You can leave all these values as `0` if your chain has opted in to Superchain-wide hardforks.

#### Genesis

The `[genesis]` section contains the hashes for the L1 start block of the rollup and the hash of the genesis of the L2. The L2 genesis hash is generated from its genesis file. Note that this is unrelated to the ZST encoding in step 4.

#### Roles and addresses

`[roles]` and `[addresses]` in the config file must also be manually updated to match the roles and addresses specified when you deployed the chain.
(If you deploy your chain using a custom tool, you will need to specify them at some point.
Keep them handy so you can add your chain to the Superchain Registry!)

### 4. ZST-encode your genesis file.

The Superchain Registry requires ZST-encoded genesis files.
To ZST-encode your genesis file, run
`zstd -D superchain-registry/superchain/extra/dictionary <your-genesis.json>`.

Put the generated file in the `.staging` directory alongside the config file.
