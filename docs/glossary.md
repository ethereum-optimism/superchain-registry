# Glossary

To help with clarity and a common understanding, here are some helpful terms and their definitions.

### General

**Superchain member:** A chain with an agreement in place to commit sequencer revenue back to the Optimism Collective.
**Blockspace charter:** A [Blockspace Charter](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-introducing-blockspace-charters-superchain-first-governance/8133) is a technical-focused governing document (and framework) for the Superchain.
**Standard chain:** A chain that conforms to the [Standard Rollup Charter - not ratified yet](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135)
**Frontier chain:** A non-standard chain that has modifications that do not fit the `Standard Rollup Charter` criteria.
**Standard chain candidate:** A chain that has met most of the standard chain criteria, except for the `ProxyAdminOwner` key handover.
**Key handover:**  A colloquial term for updating the chain's `ProxyAdminOwner` to fulfill the requirements of the standard rollup charter.

### Superchain Level and Rollup Stage

Chains in the superchain-registry are assigned a `superchain_level` (shown in individual config files as well as the `chainList.toml/json` summaries), depending on the set of validation checks that they pass.

**Frontier** chains have `superchain_level = 0`.

**Standard** chains have `superchain_level = 1`. Because they satisfy a much stricter set of validation checks (see the [Standard Rollup Blockspace Charter](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135)), they also qualify as [Stage 1](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) rollups chains.
